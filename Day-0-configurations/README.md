📦 CI/CD and Jenkins
🚀 What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for:

CI (Continuous Integration)
CD (Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment)

It is a modern software development practice that automates building, testing, and deploying applications.

🔹 Continuous Integration (CI)

Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository. Each change is automatically:

Built
Tested

👉 Goal: Detect bugs early and improve code quality.

🔹 Continuous Delivery (CD)

After CI, code changes are automatically prepared for release:

Artifacts are built
Tests are run
Deployment-ready packages are created

👉 Goal: Keep code always ready for deployment.

🔹 Continuous Deployment (CD)

Extends delivery by automatically deploying changes to production without manual approval.

👉 Goal: Faster releases with minimal human intervention.

🔧 What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to implement CI/CD pipelines.

It helps automate:

Building code
Running tests
Deploying applications
⚙️ Key Features of Jenkins
🧩 Plugin-based architecture (1000+ plugins)
🔄 Easy integration with Git, Docker, Kubernetes
📜 Pipeline as Code (Jenkinsfile)
🖥️ Web-based UI
⚡ Distributed builds (master-agent architecture)
🏗️ How Jenkins Works
Developer pushes code to repository (e.g., GitHub)
Jenkins detects the change
Jenkins pipeline triggers:
Build the application
Run tests
Generate reports
Deploy application (if successful)
📄 Sample Jenkins Pipeline (Jenkinsfile)
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building application...'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying application...'
            }
        }
    }
}
